# battleship

This is my version of well-known Battleship board game. While working on this project I improved my JavaScript, CSS and lots of other skills and learnt how to use Jest for unit-testing. Also I finally figured out how to work with webpack and any js library. 

Although the game is working, it is not 100% ready – there are several features that are missing:
- Game allows user to place ships wherever he wants. It means that it is possible to place two ships close to each other and on top of each other.
- Coordinates of enemy’s ships are hard-coded, so in order to change them you actually have to change the code. I am planning to implement random placement. 
- And, yeah, you can see enemy’s ships – i left them be for better testing and understanding how the game works.

I completed it all by myself using The Odin Project checklist. You can check it out by link: https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-javascript/courses/javascript/lessons/battleship
